# Unofficial Mapotic POIs Export Tool
I was really disappointed that Mapotic doesn't offer export for private maps so I created this tool which exports POIs into an KML file.

This is an early version which supports description in fields with type: textarea, datetime, number, select, multiple_select

Use at your own risk!
