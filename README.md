# Unofficial Mapotic POIs Export Tool
I was really disappointed that Mapotic doesn't offer export for private maps so I created this tool which exports POIs into an KML file.

This application was created in one afternoon so there is a lot of things to improve. 

All of your POI fields will be added to the description of the generated POI in KML. 

This is an early version which supports description in fields with type: textarea, datetime, number, select, multiple_select

Paths, comments and images are NOT exported at this time. This will be a feature in one of the next updates.

Use at your own risk!
